This project serves as the backend for [Command Foundry](https://foundry.gg).

## Overview
Card data is sourced from [MTGJSON](mtgjson.com) while supplementary information (e.g. acceleration, stax, tutors) are sourced by the community.

### Getting Started
#### Install
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:yharnam/mtg-foundry.git
$ npm i
```

#### Configure
* Install MySQL locally (ref: [MySQL Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/))
* Initialize this database by running `db/dbInit.sql`
* Create `db/database.json` and populate it with the following information:
    ```json
    {
      "defaultEnv": "localhost",
      "localhost": {
        "driver": "mysql",
        "host": "localhost",
        "user": "",
        "password": "",
        "database": "foundry_db",
        "multipleStatements": true
      },
      "sql-file" : true
    }
    ```
* Update your db schema to the latest version by running `$ npm run db-up`
* Set up your env variables by creating a `.env.localhost` file in the root dir and populate it with the following:
    ```
    DB_HOST=???
    DB_USER=???
    DB_PASS=???
    MTG_JSON_URL=https://www.mtgjson.com/files/AllPrintings.sql.zip
    ```


## Usage
`$ npm run download` : downloads the latest sqlite .zip file from mtgjson

`$ npm run upload` : load latest card info into the DB
* Note that the full upload exceeds the default MySQL packet size.  Should you encounter an error like `Packets out of order. Got: 1 Expected: 15`, you'll likely need to: `SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=256*1024*1024;`


## Features
